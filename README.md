# Linux System Programming Book

This is a dumping ground of tiny C programs written as I read the book, [Linux System Programming](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/linux-system-programming/9781449341527) by Robert Love.

These programs have no utilityâ€”they were written as an exercise to build a baseline familiarity with C's standard library, and glibc specifically.
